### Hi there! 👋 I'm Lucas Brixner Riça, a Portuguese-Brazilian Full-Stack Data Professional

## 👤 About me

I am what is called today a **full-stack data professional**.

I have years of experience working on data systems for financial services companies across many roles (titled or not):
business/data analyst, analytics engineer, data engineer, full-stack software engineer/developer, data scientist — and in a few brief moments even DataOps/DevOps engineer and QA engineer.
Basically I am always there to do what needs to be done for the company when duty calls.

## 🛠️ My stack

### Programming languages
(ranked by my proficiency in them)

#### "Mainstream" programming languages
1. **Python**: my mother tongue; the lingua franca of the MAD (ML/AI/data) world.
2. **JavaScript/TypeScript**: JS is a messy language with a sad type system, but it is unavoidable as it is the lingua franca of web-based front-end apps.
3. **PHP**: 7.4 and 8.x are **palatable** when compared to 5.x, but... nope, I'm not working with PHP ever again
4. _good ol'_ Java
5. _good ol'_ C

#### "Real-world" functional programming languages
1. **Scala 3**: I will pick any time over Java for JVM; much more expressive, with a sound type system.
2. **Haskell**: it has some flaws, but it is a pleasure to work with.
3. **Clojure**
